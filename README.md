The purpose of this project is to determine if there is a correlation between popular baby names by year and popular movie characters of the same year and provide a dynamic website for users to interact with.

DATA SOURCES:  We will draw data from two primary datasets as source data:
1)	Baby Names from Social Security Card Applications â€“ National Level Data.  The data (name, year of birth, sex/gender, and number) are from a 100 percent sample of Social Security card applications starting with 1879 thru 2017. The format is one .txt file.

2)	TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset.  This dataset contains full credits for both the cast and the crew of 4,800 unique movie titles. The fields we are interested in for this project are:  id, original title, release date, vote count, cast id, character (name), and gender.  The data format is divided in two .csv tables (movies, and credits)with the movie ID as the common field.
